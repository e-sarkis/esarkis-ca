Hi, I'm Elisha.

I started programming in high school, and studied at the University of Toronto and Ontario Tech.

I previously worked on Dead By Daylight as a System Programmer at Behaviour Interactive, and am currently a Senior Software Developer at Unity Technologies.

You can play all my games for free at [esarkis.itch.io](https://esarkis.itch.io/), so enjoy!
